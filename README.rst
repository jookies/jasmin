################################

|contribs| |ubuntu-package| |redhat-package| |ci| |docker| |docs| |support|

Introduction
************
Jasmin is a very complete open source SMS Gateway with many enterprise-class features such as:

* SMPP Client / Server
* HTTP Client / Server
* Console-based configuration, no service restart required
* Based on AMQP broker for store&forward mechanisms and other queuing systems
* Using Redis for in-memory DLR tracking and billing
* Advanced message routing/filtering (Simple, Roundrobin, Failover, HLR lookup, Leastcost ...)
* Supports Unicode (UTF-8) for sending out multilingual SMS
* Supports easy creation and sending of specialized/binary SMS like mono Ringtones, WAP Push, Vcards
* Supports concatenated SMS strings (long SMS)

Jasmin relies heavily on message queuing through message brokers (Using AMQP), it is designed for performance,
high traffic loads and full in-memory execution.

Jasmin core and its external connectors (used for AMQP, Redis, SMPP, HTTP, Telnet ...) are written in Python
and are mainly based on `Twisted matrix <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_, an event-driven networking engine.

Getting started
***************
Refer to `Installation steps <http://docs.jasminsms.com/en/latest/installation/index.html>`_ to get Jasmin gateway up and running quickly with a simple SMS sending scenario.

Documentation
