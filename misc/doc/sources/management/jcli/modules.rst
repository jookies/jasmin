Management CLI Modules
######################

As shown in the architecture figure :ref:`architecture`, jCli is mainly composed of management modules interfacing two
Perspective brokers (**SMPPClientManagerPB** and **RouterPB**), each module is identified as a manager of a defined scope:

 * User management
 * Group management
 * etc ..

.. note:: **filter** and **httpccm** modules are not interfacing any Perspective broker, they are facilitating
  the reuse of created filters and HTTP Client connectors in MO and MT routers, e.g. a HTTP Client connector
  may be created once and used many times in MO Routes.

.. _user_manager:

User manager
************

The User manager module is accessible through the **user** command and is providing the following features:

.. list-table:: **user** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - -l, --list
     - List all users or a group users when provided with GID
   * - -a, --add
     - Add user
   * - -e, --enable
     - Enable user
   * - -d, --disable
     - Disable user
   * - -u UID, --update=UID
     - Update user using it's UID
   * - -r UID, --remove=UID
     - Remove user using it's UID
   * - -s UID, --show=UID
     - Show user using it's UID
   * - --smpp-unbind=UID
     - Unbind user from smpp server using it's UID
   * - --smpp-ban=UID
     - Unbind and ban user from smpp server using it's UID

A User object is required for:

 * :doc:`/apis/smpp-server/index` authentication to send a SMS (c.f. :ref:`sending_sms-mt`)
 * :doc:`/apis/ja-http/index` authentication to send a SMS (c.f. :ref:`sending_sms-mt`)
 * Creating a **UserFilter** using the **filter** manager (c.f. :ref:`filter_manager`)

Every User **must** be a member of a Group, so before adding a new User, there must be at least one Group
available, Groups are identified by *GID* (Group ID).

When adding a User, the following parameters are required:

 * **username**: A unique username used for authentication
 * **password**
 * **uid**: A unique identifier, can be same as **username**
 * **gid**: Group Identfier
 * **mt_messaging_cred** (*optional*): MT Messaging credentials (c.f. :ref:`user_credentials`)

Here's an example of adding a new User to the **marketing** group::

   jcli : user -a
   Adding a new User: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > username foo
   > password bar
   > gid marketing
   > uid foo
   > ok
   Successfully added User [foo] to Group [marketing]

All the above parameters can be displayed after User creation, except the password::

   jcli : user -s foo
   username foo
   mt_messaging_cred defaultvalue src_addr None
   mt_messaging_cred quota http_throughput ND
   mt_messaging_cred quota balance ND
   mt_messaging_cred quota smpps_throughput ND
   mt_messaging_cred quota sms_count ND

   mt_messaging_cred valuefilter priority ^[0-3]$
   mt_messaging_cred valuefilter content .*
   mt_messaging_cred valuefilter src_addr .*
   mt_messaging_cred valuefilter dst_addr .*
   mt_messaging_cred valuefilter validity_period ^\d+$
   mt_messaging_cred authorization http_send True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization http_dlr_method True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization http_balance True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization smpps_send True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization priority True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization http_long_content True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization src_addr True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization dlr_level True
   mt_messaging_cred authorization http_rate True

   mt_messaging_cred authorization http_bulk False
   mt_messaging_cred authorization hex_content True
   uid foo
   smpps_cred quota max_bindings ND
   smpps_cred authorization bind True
   gid marketing

Listing Users will show currently added Users with their UID, GID and Username::

   jcli : user -l
   #User id          Group id         Username         Balance MT SMS Throughput
   #foo              1                foo              ND      ND     ND/ND
   Total Users: 1

.. note:: When listing a *disabled* user, his User id will be prefixed by **!**, same thing apply to group.

.. _user_credentials:

User credentials
================

MT Messaging section
--------------------

As seen above, User have an optional **mt_messaging_cred** parameter which define a set of sections:

* **Authorizations**: Privileges to send messages and set some defined parameters,
* **Value filters**: Restrictions on some parameter values (such as source address),
* **Default values**: Default parameter values to be set by Jasmin when not manually set by User,
* **Quotas**: Everything about :doc:`/billing/index`,

For each section of the above, there's keys to be defined when adding/updating a user, the example below show how to set a source address **value filter**, a balance of **44.2**, **unlimited** sms_count and limit SMS throughput in smpp server to 2 messages per second::

   jcli : user -a
   Adding a new User: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > username foo
   > password bar
   > gid marketing
   > uid foo
   > mt_messaging_cred valuefilter src_addr ^JASMIN$
   > mt_messaging_cred quota balance 44.2
   > mt_messaging_cred quota sms_count none
   > mt_messaging_cred quota smpps_throughput 2
   > ok
   Successfully added User [foo] to Group [marketing]

.. note:: Setting *none* value to a user quota will set it as *unlimited* quota.

SMPP Server section
-------------------

User have an other optional **smpps_cred** parameter which define a specialized set of sections for defining his credentials for using the :doc:`/apis/smpp-server/index`:

* **Authorizations**: Privileges to bind,
* **Quotas**: Maximum bound connections at a time (multi binding),

For each section of the above, there's keys to be defined when adding/updating a user, the example below show how to **authorize** binding and set max_bindings to **2**::

   jcli : user -a
   Adding a new User: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > username foo
   > password bar
   > gid marketing
   > uid foo
   > smpps_cred authorization bind yes

.. _group_manager:

Group manager
*************

The Group manager module is accessible through the **group** command and is providing the following features:

.. list-table:: **group** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - -l, --list
     - List groups

A Group object is required for:

 * Creating a **User** using the **user** manager (c.f. :ref:`user_manager`)
 * Creating a **GroupFilter** using the **filter** manager (c.f. :ref:`filter_manager`)

When adding a Group, only one parameter is required:

 * **gid**: Group Identfier

Here's an example of adding a new Group::

   jcli : group -a
   Adding a new Group: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > gid marketing
   > ok
   Successfully added Group [marketing]

Listing Groups will show currently added Groups with their GID::

   jcli : group  -l
   #Group id
   #marketing
   Total Groups: 1

.. note:: When listing a *disabled* group, its group id will be prefixed by **!**.

.. _morouter_manager:

MO router manager
*****************

The MO Router manager module is accessible through the **morouter** command and is providing the following features:

.. list-table:: **morouter** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - -l, --list
     - List MO routes
   * - -a, --add
     - Add a new MO route
   * - -r ORDER, --remove=ORDER
     - Remove MO route using it's ORDER
   * - -s ORDER, --show=ORDER
     - Show MO route using it's ORDER
   * - -f, --flush
     - Flush MO routing table

.. note:: MO Route is used to route inbound messages (SMS MO) through two possible channels: http and smpps (SMPP Server).

MO Router helps managing Jasmin's MORoutingTable, which is responsible of providing routes to received
SMS MO, here are the basics of Jasmin MO routing mechanism:

 #. **MORoutingTable** holds ordered **MORoute** objects (each MORoute has a unique order)
 #. A **MORoute** is composed of:

     * **Filters**: One or many filters (c.f. :ref:`filter_manager`)
     * **Connector**: One connector (can be *many* in some situations)

 #. There's many objects inheriting **MORoute** to provide flexible ways to route messages:

     * **DefaultRoute**: A route without a filter, this one can only set with the lowest order to be a
       default/fallback route
     * **StaticMORoute**: A basic route with **Filters** and one **Connector**
     * **RandomRoundrobinMORoute**: A route with **Filters** and many **Connectors**, will return a random
       **Connector** if its **Filters** are matched, can be used as a load balancer route
     * **FailoverMORoute**: A route with **Filters** and many **Connectors**, will return an available (connected)
       **Connector** if its **Filters** are matched

 #. When a SMS MO is received, Jasmin will ask for the right **MORoute** to consider, all routes are checked
    in descendant order for their respective **Filters** (when a **MORoute** have many filters, they are checked
    with an **AND** boolean operator)
 #. When a **MORoute** is considered (its **Filters** are matching a received SMS MO), Jasmin will use
    its **Connector** to send the SMS MO.

Check :doc:`/routing/index` for more details about Jasmin's routing.

When adding a MO Route, the following parameters are required:

 * **type**: One of the supported MO Routes: DefaultRoute, StaticMORoute, RandomRoundrobinMORoute
 * **order**: MO Route order

When choosing the MO Route **type**, additional parameters may be added to the above required parameters.

Here's an example of adding a **DefaultRoute** to a HTTP Client Connector (http_default)::

   jcli : morouter -a
   Adding a new MO Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type DefaultRoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.DefaultRoute arguments:
   connector
   > connector http(http_default)
   > ok
   Successfully added MORoute [DefaultRoute] with order:0

.. note:: You don't have to set **order** parameter when the MO Route type is **DefaultRoute**, it will be automatically set to 0

Here's an example of adding a **StaticMORoute** to a HTTP Client Connector (http_1)::

   jcli : morouter -a
   Adding a new MO Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type StaticMORoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.StaticMORoute arguments:
   filters, connector
   > order 10
   > filters filter_1
   > connector http(http_1)
   > ok
   Successfully added MORoute [StaticMORoute] with order:10

Here's an example of adding a **StaticMORoute** to a SMPP Server user (user_1)::

   jcli : morouter -a
   Adding a new MO Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type StaticMORoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.StaticMORoute arguments:
   filters, connector
   > order 15
   > filters filter_2
   > connector smpps(user_1)
   > ok
   Successfully added MORoute [StaticMORoute] with order:15

.. note:: When routing to a smpps connector like the above example the **user_1** designates the **username** of the concerned user, if he's already bound to Jasmin's :doc:`/apis/smpp-server/index` routed messages will be delivered to him, if not, queuing will take care of delivery.

Here's an example of adding a **RandomRoundrobinMORoute** to two HTTP Client Connectors (http_2 and http_3)::

   jcli : morouter -a
   Adding a new MO Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type RandomRoundrobinMORoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.RandomRoundrobinMORoute arguments:
   filters, connectors
   > filters filter_3;filter_1
   > connectors http(http_2);http(http_3)
   > order 20
   > ok
   Successfully added MORoute [RandomRoundrobinMORoute] with order:20

.. note:: It is possible to use a **RoundRobinMORoute** with a mix of connectors, example: **connectors smpps(user_1);http(http_1);http(http_3)**.

Here's an example of adding a **FailoverMORoute** to two HTTP Client Connectors (http_4 and http_5)::

   jcli : morouter -a
   Adding a new MO Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type FailoverMORoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.FailoverMORoute arguments:
   filters, connectors
   > filters filter_4
   > connectors http(http_4);http(http_5)
   > order 30
   > ok
   Successfully added MORoute [FailoverMORoute] with order:20

.. note:: It is **not possible** to use a **FailoverMORoute** with a mix of connectors, example: **connectors smpps(user_1);http(http_1);http(http_3)**.

Once the above MO Routes are added to **MORoutingTable**, it is possible to list these routes::

   jcli : morouter -l
   #Order Type                    Connector ID(s)                  Filter(s)
   #30    FailoverMORoute         http(http_4), http(http_5)       <T>, <T>
   #20    RandomRoundrobinMORoute http(http_2), http(http_3)       <T>, <T>
   #15    StaticMORoute           smpps(user_1)                    <T>
   #10    StaticMORoute           http(http_1)                     <T>
   #0     DefaultRoute            http(http_default)
   Total MO Routes: 3

.. note:: Filters and Connectors were created before creating these routes, please check :ref:`filter_manager` and :ref:`httpccm_manager` for further details

It is possible to obtain more information of a defined route by typing **moroute -s <order>**::

   jcli : morouter -s 20
   RandomRoundrobinMORoute to 2 connectors:
      - http(http_2)
      - http(http_3)

   jcli : morouter -s 10
   StaticMORoute to http(http_1)

   jcli : morouter -s 0
   DefaultRoute to http(http_default)

More control commands:

* **morouter -r <order>**: Remove route at defined *order*
* **morouter -f**: Flush MORoutingTable (unrecoverable)

.. _mtrouter_manager:

MT router manager
*****************

The MT Router manager module is accessible through the **mtrouter** command and is providing the following features:

.. list-table:: **mtrouter** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - -l, --list
     - List MT routes
   * - -a, --add
     - Add a new MT route
   * - -r ORDER, --remove=ORDER
     - Remove MT route using it's ORDER
   * - -s ORDER, --show=ORDER
     - Show MT route using it's ORDER
   * - -f, --flush
     - Flush MT routing table

.. note:: MT Route is used to route outbound messages (SMS MT) through one channel: smppc (SMPP Client).

MT Router helps managing Jasmin's MTRoutingTable, which is responsible of providing routes to outgoing SMS MT,
here are the basics of Jasmin MT routing mechanism:

 #. **MTRoutingTable** holds ordered **MTRoute** objects (each MTRoute has a unique order)
 #. A **MTRoute** is composed of:

     * **Filters**: One or many filters (c.f. :ref:`filter_manager`)
     * **Connector**: One connector (can be *many* in some situations)
     * **Rate**: For billing purpose, the rate of sending one message through this route; it can be zero
       to mark the route as FREE (NOT RATED) (c.f. :doc:`/billing/index`)

 #. There's many objects inheriting **MTRoute** to provide flexible ways to route messages:

     * **DefaultRoute**: A route without a filter, this one can only set with the lowest order to be a
       default/fallback route
     * **StaticMTRoute**: A basic route with **Filters** and one **Connector**
     * **RandomRoundrobinMTRoute**: A route with **Filters** and many **Connectors**, will return a random
       **Connector** if its **Filters** are matching, can be used as a load balancer route
     * **FailoverMTRoute**: A route with **Filters** and many **Connectors**, will return an available (connected)
       **Connector** if its **Filters** are matched

 #. When a SMS MT is to be sent, Jasmin will ask for the right **MTRoute** to consider, all routes are checked
    in descendant order for their respective **Filters** (when a **MTRoute** have many filters, they are checked
    with an **AND** boolean operator)
 #. When a **MTRoute** is considered (its **Filters** are matching an outgoing SMS MT), Jasmin will use
    its **Connector** to send the SMS MT.

Check :doc:`/routing/index` for more details about Jasmin's routing.

When adding a MT Route, the following parameters are required:

 * **type**: One of the supported MT Routes: DefaultRoute, StaticMTRoute, RandomRoundrobinMTRoute
 * **order**: MO Route order
 * **rate**: The route rate, can be zero

When choosing the MT Route **type**, additional parameters may be added to the above required parameters.

Here's an example of adding a **DefaultRoute** to a SMPP Client Connector (smppcc_default)::

   jcli : mtrouter -a
   Adding a new MT Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type DefaultRoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.DefaultRoute arguments:
   connector
   > connector smppc(smppcc_default)
   > rate 0.0
   > ok
   Successfully added MTRoute [DefaultRoute] with order:0

.. note:: You don't have to set **order** parameter when the MT Route type is **DefaultRoute**, it will be automatically
         set to 0

Here's an example of adding a **StaticMTRoute** to a SMPP Client Connector (smppcc_1)::

   jcli : mtrouter -a
   Adding a new MT Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type StaticMTRoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.StaticMTRoute arguments:
   filters, connector
   > filters filter_1;filter_2
   > order 10
   > connector smppc(smppcc_1)
   > rate 0.0
   > ok
   Successfully added MTRoute [StaticMTRoute] with order:10

Here's an example of adding a **RandomRoundrobinMTRoute** to two SMPP Client Connectors (smppcc_2 and smppcc_3)::

   jcli : mtrouter -a
   Adding a new MT Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > order 20
   > type RandomRoundrobinMTRoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.RandomRoundrobinMTRoute arguments:
   filters, connectors
   > filters filter_3
   > connectors smppc(smppcc_2);smppc(smppcc_3)
   > rate 0.0
   > ok
   Successfully added MTRoute [RandomRoundrobinMTRoute] with order:20

Here's an example of adding a **FailoverMTRoute** to two SMPP Client Connectors (smppcc_4 and smppcc_5)::

   jcli : mtrouter -a
   Adding a new MT Route: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > order 30
   > type FailoverMTRoute
   jasmin.routing.Routes.FailoverMTRoute arguments:
   filters, connectors
   > filters filter_4
   > connectors smppc(smppcc_4);smppc(smppcc_5)
   > rate 0.0
   > ok
   Successfully added MTRoute [FailoverMTRoute] with order:20

Once the above MT Routes are added to **MTRoutingTable**, it is possible to list these routes::

   jcli : mtrouter -l
   #Order Type                    Rate    Connector ID(s)                     Filter(s)

MO interceptor manager
**********************

The MO Interceptor manager module is accessible through the **mointerceptor** command and is providing the following features:

.. list-table:: **mointerceptor** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - -l, --list
     - List MO interceptors
   * - -a, --add
     - Add a new MO interceptors
   * - -r ORDER, --remove=ORDER
     - Remove MO interceptor using it's ORDER
   * - -s ORDER, --show=ORDER
     - Show MO interceptor using it's ORDER
   * - -f, --flush
     - Flush MO interception table

.. note:: MO Interceptor is used to hand inbound messages (SMS MO) to a user defined script, check
  :doc:`/interception/index` for more details.

MO Interceptor helps managing Jasmin's MOInterceptionTable, which is responsible of intercepting SMS MO before
routing is made, here are the basics of Jasmin MO interception mechanism:

 #. **MOInterceptionTable** holds ordered **MOInterceptor** objects (each MOInterceptor has a unique order)
 #. A **MOInterceptor** is composed of:

     * **Filters**: One or many filters (c.f. :ref:`filter_manager`)
     * **Script**: Path to python script

 #. There's many objects inheriting **MOInterceptor** to provide flexible ways to route messages:

     * **DefaultInterceptor**: An interceptor without a filter, this one can only set with the lowest order to be a
       default/fallback interceptor
     * **StaticMOInterceptor**: A basic interceptor with **Filters** and one **Script**

 #. When a SMS MO is received, Jasmin will ask for the right **MOInterceptor** to consider, all interceptors are checked
    in descendant order for their respective **Filters** (when a **MOInterceptor** have many filters, they are checked
    with an **AND** boolean operator)
 #. When a **MOInterceptor** is considered (its **Filters** are matching a received SMS MO), Jasmin will call
    its **Script** with the **Routable** argument.

Check :doc:`/interception/index` for more details about Jasmin's interceptor.

When adding a MO Interceptor, the following parameters are required:

 * **type**: One of the supported MO Interceptors: DefaultInterceptor, StaticMOInterceptor
 * **order**: MO Interceptor order

When choosing the MO Interceptor **type**, additional parameters may be added to the above required parameters.

Here's an example of adding a **DefaultInterceptor** to a python script::

  jcli : mointerceptor -a
  Adding a new MO Interceptor: (ok: save, ko: exit)
  > type DefaultInterceptor
  <class 'jasmin.routing.Interceptors.DefaultInterceptor'> arguments:
  script
  > script python2(/opt/jasmin-scripts/interception/mo-interceptor.py)
  > ok
  Successfully added MOInterceptor [DefaultInterceptor] with order:0

.. note:: As of now, only **python2** script is permitted.

.. note:: Pay attention that the given script is copied to Jasmin core, do not expect Jasmin to refresh the script
  code when you update it, you'll need to redefine the *mointerceptor* rule again so Jasmin will refresh the script.

.. note:: You don't have to set **order** parameter when the MO Interceptor type is **DefaultInterceptor**,
  it will be automatically set to 0

Here's an example of adding a **StaticMOInterceptor** to a python script::

  jcli : mointerceptor -a
  Adding a new MO Interceptor: (ok: save, ko: exit)
  > type StaticMOInterceptor
  <class 'jasmin.routing.Interceptors.StaticMOInterceptor'> arguments:
  filters, script
  > order 10
  > filters filter_1
  > script python2(/opt/jasmin-scripts/interception/mo-interceptor.py)
  > ok
  Successfully added MOInterceptor [StaticMOInterceptor] with order:10

Once the above MO Interceptors are added to **MOInterceptionTable**, it is possible to list these interceptors::

  jcli : mointerceptor -l
  #Order    Type                    Script                    Filter(s)
  #10       StaticMOInterceptor     <MOIS (pyCode= ..)>       <T>
  #0        DefaultInterceptor      <MOIS (pyCode= ..)>
  Total MO Interceptors: 2

.. note:: Filters were created before creating these interceptors, please check :ref:`filter_manager` for further details

It is possible to obtain more information of a defined interceptor by typing **mointerceptor -s <order>**::

  jcli : mointerceptor -s 10
  StaticMOInterceptor/<MOIS (pyCode= ..)>

  jcli : mointerceptor -s 0
  DefaultInterceptor/<MOIS (pyCode= ..)>

More control commands:

* **mointerceptor -r <order>**: Remove interceptor at defined *order*
* **mointerceptor -f**: Flush MOInterceptionTable (unrecoverable)

.. note:: When adding a SMPP Client connector, only it's **cid** is required, all the other parameters will
         be set to their respective defaults.

.. note:: Connector restart is required only when changing the following parameters: **host**, **port**, **username**,
         **password**, **systemType**, **logfile**, **loglevel**; any other change is applied without requiring connector
         to be restarted.

Here’s an example of adding a new **transmitter** SMPP Client connector with **cid=Demo**::

   jcli : smppccm -a
   Adding a new connector: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > cid Demo
   > bind transmitter
   > ok
   Successfully added connector [Demo]

All the above parameters can be displayed after connector creation::

   jcli : smppccm -s Demo
   ripf 0
   con_fail_delay 10
   dlr_expiry 86400
   coding 0
   submit_throughput 1
   elink_interval 10
   bind_to 30
   port 2775
   con_fail_retry yes
   password password
   src_addr None
   bind_npi 1
   addr_range None

   bind transmitter
   proto_id None
   con_loss_delay 10
   bind_ton 0
   pdu_red_to 10
   src_ton 2

.. note:: From the example above, you can see that showing a connector details will return all it's parameters
          even those you did not enter while creating/updating the connector, they will take their respective
          default values as explained in :ref:`smppcc_params`

Listing connectors will show currently added SMPP Client connectors with their CID, Service/Session state and
start/stop counters::

   jcli : smppccm -l
   #Connector id                        Service Session          Starts Stops
   #888                                 stopped None             0      0
   #Demo                                stopped None             0      0
   Total connectors: 2

Updating an existent connector is the same as creating a new one, simply type **smppccm -u <cid>** where **cid**
is the connector id you want to update, you'll run into a new interactive session to enter the parameters you
want to update (c.f. :ref:`smppcc_params`).

Here’s an example of updating SMPP Client connector's host::

   jcli : smppccm -u Demo
   Updating connector id [Demo]: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > host 10.10.1.2
   > ok
   Successfully updated connector [Demo]

More control commands:

* **smppccm -1 <cid>**: Start connector and try to connect
* **smppccm -0 <cid>**: Stop connector and disconnect
* **smppccm -r <cid>**: Remove connector (unrecoverable)

It is possible to obtain more information of a specific filter by typing **filter -s <fid>**::

   jcli : filter -s September2014
   DateIntervalFilter:
   Left border = 2014-09-01
   Right border = 2014-09-30

More control commands:

* **filter -r <fid>**: Remove filter

.. _external_buslogig_filters:

External business logic
=======================

In addition to predefined filters listed above (:ref:`filter_manager`), it is possible to extend
filtering with external scripts written in Python using the **EvalPyFilter**.

Here's a very simple example where an **EvalPyFilter** is matching the connector **cid** of a message:

**First, write an external python script**:

.. code-block:: python

   # File @ /opt/jasmin-scripts/routing/abc-connector.py
   if routable.connector.cid == 'abc':
       result = True
   else:
       result = False

**Second, create an EvalPyFilter with the python script**::

   jcli : filter -a
   Adding a new Filter: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > type EvalPyFilter
   jasmin.routing.Filters.EvalPyFilter arguments:
   pyCode
   > pyCode /opt/jasmin-scripts/routing/abc-connector.py
   > fid SimpleThirdParty
   > ok
   Successfully added Filter [EvalPyFilter] with fid:SimpleThirdParty

This example will provide an **EvalPyFilter** (SimpleThirdParty) that will match any message coming from
the connector with **cid** = abc.

Using **EvalPyFilter** is as simple as the shown example, when the python script is called it will get the
following global variables set:

* **routable**: one of the *jasmin.routing.Routables.Routable* inheriters (:ref:`Route_Routable` for more details)
* **result**: (default to *False*) It will be read by Jasmin router at the end of the script execution to check
  if the filter is matching the message passed through the routable variable, matched=True / unmatched=False

.. note:: It is possible to check for any parameter of the SMPP PDU: TON, NPI, PROTOCOL_ID ... since it is provided through
          the **routable** object.
.. note:: Using **EvalPyFilter** offers the possibility to call external webservices, databases ... for powerfull
          routing or even for logging, rating & billing through external third party systems.

.. _httpccm_manager:

HTTP Client connector manager
*****************************

The HTTP Client connector manager module is accessible through the **httpccm** command and is providing the
following features:

.. list-table:: **httpccm** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - -l, --list
     - List HTTP client connectors
   * - -a, --add
     - Add a new HTTP client connector
   * - -r FID, --remove=FID
     - Remove HTTP client connector using it's CID
   * - -s FID, --show=FID
     - Show HTTP client connector using it's CID

A HTTP Client connector is used in SMS-MO routing, it is called with the message parameters when it is returned
by a matched MO Route (:ref:`receiving_sms-mo` for more details).

When adding a HTTP Client connector, the following parameters are required:

 * **cid**: Connector id (must be unique)
 * **url**: URL to be called with message parameters
 * **method**: Calling method (GET or POST)

Here's an example of adding a new HTTP Client connector::

   jcli : httpccm -a
   Adding a new Httpcc: (ok: save, ko: exit)
   > url http://10.10.20.125/receive-sms/mo.php
   > method GET
   > cid HTTP-01
   > ok
   Successfully added Httpcc [HttpConnector] with cid:HTTP-01

All the above parameters can be displayed after Connector creation::

   jcli : httpccm -s HTTP-01
   HttpConnector:
   cid = HTTP-01
   baseurl = http://10.10.20.125/receive-sms/mo.php
   method = GET

Listing Connectors will show currently added Connectors with their CID, Type, Method and Url::

   jcli : httpccm -l
   #Httpcc id        Type                   Method URL
   #HTTP-01          HttpConnector          GET    http://10.10.20.125/receive-sms/mo.php
   Total Httpccs: 1

.. _stats_manager:

Stats manager
*************

The Stats manager module is responsible for showing real time statistics, aggregated counters and values such as current bound connections of a User, number of http requests, number of sent messages through a Route, Filter, Connector ...

.. note:: All values are collected during Jasmin's uptime and they are lost when Jasmin goes off, Stats manager shall be used for monitoring activities but not for advanced business reports.

The Stats manager module is accessible through the **stats** command and is providing the following features:

.. list-table:: **stats** command line options
   :widths: 10 90
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - --user=UID
     - Show user stats using it's UID
   * - --users
     - Show all users stats
   * - --smppc=CID
     - Show smpp connector stats using it's CID
   * - --smppcs
     - Show all smpp connectors stats
   * - --smppsapi
     - Show SMPP Server API stats

The Stats manager covers different sections, this includes Users, SMPP Client connectors, Routes (MO and MT), APIs (HTTP and SMPP).

User statistics
===============

The Stats manager exposes an overall view of all existent users as well as a per-user information view:

 * **stats --users**: Will show an overall view of all existent users
 * **stats --user foo**: Will show detailed information for **foo**

Here's an example of showing an overall view where users **sandra** and **foo** are actually having 2 and 6 SMPP bound connections, user **bar** is using the HTTP Api only and **sandra** is using both APIs::

   jcli : stats --users
   #User id  SMPP Bound connections  SMPP L.A.            HTTP requests counter  HTTP L.A.
   #sandra   2                       2019-06-02 15:35:01  20                     2019-06-01 12:12:33
   #foo      6                       2019-06-02 15:35:10  0                      ND
   #bar      0                       ND                   1289                   2019-06-02 15:39:12
